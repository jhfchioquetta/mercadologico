<h1>About the project</h1>
This is my first bootstrap static landing page, built only with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Boxicons resources. I chose to use Bootstrap to learn how to use it and become familiar with a popular CSS framework.

I've done it by following a tutorial, making it my way, arranging elements to be coherent with the visual identity I've created for the brand.

It was exciting to see the project coming along and things starting to look nice.

<h2>Steps and Issues</h2>

The project was built by sections. Watching a video tutorial helped a lot, but I had to figure out how to make every section the way I wanted; a few tweaks a time.
Most of the sections were made adjusting Bootstrap templates.

Issues: 
  - Searching about how to publish my webpage on GitHub Pages I've realized that I really needed to commit via terminal, not via browser. That I did and it worked. The problem was GitHub wasn't able to find my files paths because they were inside folders, and my folders haven't been uploaded when I tried via browser.
  - Reading Git and GitHub documents, searching video tutorials, I was able to upload and publish my webpage successfully.

It feels really amazing to me to finally be able to do such a task, which I've never done before.

Mercadologico is a real brand, created by me, but not a successful one. It has given me a few opportunities, although couldn't find a path to be prosperous so far. Maybe this landing page can be used for something, I still don't know what the future holds for me.
