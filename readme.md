<h1>About the project</h1>
This is my first bootstrap static landing page, built only with HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Boxicons resources. I chose to use Bootstrap to learn how to use it and become familiar with a popular CSS framework.

I've done it by following a tutorial, making it my way, arranging elements to be coherent with the visual identity I've created for the brand.

It was exciting to see the project coming along and things starting to look nice.

<h2>Steps and Issues</h2>

The project was built by sections. Watching a video tutorial helped a lot, but I had to figure out how to make every section the way I wanted; a few tweaks a time.
Most of the sections were made adjusting Bootstrap templates.

Issues: 
  - I'm currently struggling with css and images failing to load. The files are in a different path than what the code is trying to get, but I still haven't figured how to fix it.
  - I'm not really sure about how to organize files in GitHub. Using the Git terminal is still a challenge for me, even though I understand what it is and how it works.

I guess doing things always comes with its perks. That's why I'm just building stuff, regardless of how much I still have to learn. By just studying and not doing, my fate is to ever be postponing and not learning necessary skills.

Mercadologico is a real brand, created by me, but not a successful one. It has given me a few opportunities, although couldn't find a path to be prosperous so far. Maybe this landing page can be used for something, I still don't know what the future holds for me.

If you like this project, please let me know. I will surely appreciate positive feedback.
